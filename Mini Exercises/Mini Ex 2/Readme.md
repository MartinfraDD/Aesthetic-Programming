## Working with fun
For this assignment we were asked to create a simple program, that would convey a sense of fun through the code. What I decided to create, was a sort of interactive story, wherein the person uses their **Left Mouse Button** to progress the story.

### It's very easy to break this program, so please just click one time per action! 
## Some background

Since we were given the assignment, I've erally wanted to create some sort of interactive story, which I didn't anticipate would be very difficult. This program contains both shapes created through the use of code, as well as some hand drawn images. I believe it creates a nice seperation between what happens in the foreground and background, and that it might be surprising to some, when they can affect the background directly.
## Technical difficulties
It was quite difficult for me to get the inputs to work correctly, so that the user's actions would move the story along. The result of this struggle is some very messy code, wherin the background is redrawn in each new scene, which unfortunately makes it difficult to read. Through the use of tutorials and other online resources, I was finally able to make the program work, however, not optimally. Ideally, the user would not be able to make the dialogue repeat by rapidly pressing the mouse button, but unfortunately I was unable to find a solution to this issue in time. 
The way the dialogue is spaced out is thanks to a command called 'setTimeout(function, miliseconds);, through this I could make both make the character speak and animate (very crudely). Other than that the code mostly consists of drawn objects, mouse inputs, sound files and image files. Despite the large amount of files, the program is only about 5mb total, which was a relief for me. 
## Back to the fun stuff
With regard to the aspect of fun, as presented by Olga Goriunova, I felt that it would be neat to create something that conveys a very simple story, using only very simple shapes and characters. I sincerely hope that people will find the scenario humourous, or at least novel. Seeing as it is quite easy to break the sequence of the program I've made, I do believe that one might find it fun to mess with the program in ways that were not intended by me, especially considering I asked people not to do that in the opening of this readme
