Describe about your throbber design, both conceptually and technically.
What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?
Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture e.g streaming video on YouTube or loading latest feeds on Facebook or waiting a ticket transaction, what do you think a throbber tells us, and/or hides, about? How might we think about this remarkable throbber icon differently
