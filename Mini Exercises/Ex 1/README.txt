Going into this assignment, I spent a lot of time imagining different fun things that can be done with my limited coding abilities. During the assignment I’ve been toying around with a bunch of different concepts, each of them very minor in scope, but still quite challenging for me in terms of what I am able to do with the limited coding toolset that I have. With each project I tried, I would hit multiple roadblocks, which would force me to halt the process itself, in order to get help from various tutorials and online resources. With each roadblock however, I learned something new in terms of how coding in Javascript works. For example, I had not previously given much thought to how the order the code is written in impacts the final product, but now this one of the many things I’ll try to keep in mind moving forward. 


The result of this whole process is a program in which you can make dogs bark to a beat using your keyboard. Both the program and the code itself are quite simple, but I was really quite pleased to been able to express something so weird through the use of code. I’m very much looking forward to what will be possible to create in the future. Much of my knowledge of GitHub can be attributed to my peers in the study group I’m in. Working with them has made GitHub seem much less intimidating and daunting than it would if I were on my own. 
In my experience, the early process of learning code interchanges between high peaks and low valleys, at a very frantic rate. While coding can easily become a source of frustration when it goes wrong, the gratification I’ve gotten from writing clean and functional code (albeit simple) cannot be understated. It might seem absurd how pleased I am having made a Rapping Dog Program, but I feel that most people who’ve struggled with code can relate to the joy it brings to have something functional.


Much like when learning a new language, the rules of coding can often seem overcomplicated and unintuitive, but as your knowledge of the language increases, you might be able to express yourself and your ideas in a way that you were not previously aware of. I think this is what excites me most about coding. A proficient coder is not only able to express their own ideas in a way that is interpretable by a machine, but they are also able to externalize their ideas to the whole world through these machines that exist all over the globe. 
At this point, my coding ability is extremely low, and thus the ways in which I can express myself through code are also quite limited, I look very much forward to developing my abilities along with my peers in the near future!
