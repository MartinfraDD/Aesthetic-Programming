## Working With Flow Charts

For this weeks assignment we were asked to create a variety of flowcharts, both individually and in groups, which would visualise 
either past or future mini exercises. In this Readme I will first focus on my individually made flowchart, and then the two group flowcharts
after that. 



### Individual flowchart:

In approaching our individual work, we were asked to use our most complex past mini-ex to visualise through our flowchart. For this reason 
I have decided to focus on my fifth mini exercise "Deep Seeing", which was originally done with a focus on object-oriented programming.
#### [Here is a link to the page](https://github.com/MartinfraDD/Aesthetic-Programming/blob/master/Mini%20Exercises/Mini%20Ex%205/Readme.md).
I believe we were told at one point, that we should design our flowcharts with the condition that our mothers should be able to understand the program, which
is something I've attempted to do here:

I think it's been interesting to see how other's have tackled their flowcharts, seeing as some has taken a very technical focus, which 
explores the programs functions on a detailed level, while my own flowchart simply conveys the functions on a perhaps more superficial level,
which hopefully everyone can understand. Seeing as I my focus was on my most technically complex program, it's funny how simplified one can make it. 

I wondered for a while about how much should be included in this flowchart, for example, each fish will have a randomly selected appearance 
based on several different illustrations. I chose not to include this aspect in the flowchart, since it was not required for people to understand
how the program functions, instead I've just written that "random fish are spawned". 

While I do believe that something is gained through making the program a lot more understandable through this heavily simplified flowchart, 
something is also lost, mainly the smaller details of how the program functions. Thus this flowchart has become more of a way to visualise 
how the game works, rather than a more educational work, which could give others insight into each process of the program. I am unsure 
if one approach is better than the other, but I do think this is an important thing to reflect upon when deciding how to approach making a flowchart.
Ultimately, I suppose my point is just that one should fit their flowchart to the context of which it is needed. In my case, I'll try to see if my 
mother can decipher my flowchart.
